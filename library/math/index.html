		<h3>Introduction</h3>

		<p>
			Robotics is a field that requires math. Like a <i>lot</i> of it.
			It's one step below scientific simulations and computer graphics.
			It relies on a wide range of topics, but usually has a viable solution
			using only fundamentals. Lets go over many of the topics that come up
			in robotics, embedded systems, and primitive AI. Keep an eye out for
			bolded lines, they are questions you should be able to answer at that point.

		<h3><a id="Geometry">Geometry</a></h3>

		<p>
			Geometry is so critical to everything we do. Spatial reasoning, mechanical
			engineering, rushing through the grocery store as quick as possible, or
			maybe you recently found out just how many things can fit into
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pDH66X3ClA">the square hole</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is especially important to robotics and CAD software. Computer-Aided Design
			software is not explicitly a tool for laying out geometry with automated
			equations and analysis for engineers, but that is what the term has become.
			If you haven't taken a class on CAD from any mentors, give it a shot. It will
			expand your knowledge of robot design quite a bit!

		<strong>Trigonometry</strong>

		<p>
			This is the study on the relationship between triangles and circles. While
			at a surface level the two couldn't be <i>less</i> similar, they are in fact
			tightly related by the way of right triangles and the unit circle. Pay close
			attention to the relationship between degrees and radians, 1&pi; = 180<sup>&deg;</sup>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Lets get the unit circle out of the way first, it's a very special and powerful
			shape. The unit circle has a radius of 1, and its points can be represented in
			either cartesian coordinates (ie, {x, y}) or polar coordinates (ie, {&theta;, r}).
			Note that in polar coordinates since the radius is always 1 it can be left off if stated.
		</p>

		<p align="center">
			<img src="unit-circle.png" alt="Unit Circle Image Not Found." style="width: 400px; height: 400px" />
		</p>

		<p>
			What's great about this shape is that each point on the circle represents
			a pair of calculations: {x, y} = {cos(&theta;), sin(&theta;)}. Each can be
			derived from the other. This relationship comes up constantly in the real
			world, engineering, and physics, whether it's intended or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now lets look at the right triangle. That previous relationship only holds
			true in a right triangle: a triangle with a 90 degree angle. This is because
			of the identity property of 1. When you form the pythagorean equation with
			a unit circle, you see that c=1 and 1=a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>. It may not seem like much,
			but this simple equation opens up a <i>lot</i> of doors.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Given value of a point on the unit circle, could you calculate the <i>y</i>
				value if you know the <i>x</i> value is sin(&pi;/6)?</strong> ( sin() is deliberate,
			keep your answer in terms of cos() or sin() )
		</p>

		<hr />

		<strong>Arc Length</strong>

		<p>
			Lets build off the idea of curved distances, and for simplicities sake we'll use a circle still. This is
			something called an
			<a href="https://andymath.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-17-at-12.14.25-PM.png">Arc
				Length</a>.
			You can estimate the distance of an arc length by drawing a <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(geometry)"><i>chord</i></a>
			between two points on a circle, and calculating the length of that line. Since you've just graduate from
			Trigonometry School,
			you can calculate those two points along any circle. As a hint to make this simpler, you can actually tackle
			this problem by
			starting off with only 1 point because any arclength of radius &theta; has the same result at any spot on a
			circle, and the
			start of a circle is always at {r, 0} which is both a polar coordinate {r, &theta;} and a cartesian
			coordiate {x, y}.
			Once you have your second coordinate in cartesian values, observe that the chord is shorter than the
			arclength over those 2 points.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is an estimate, and as you add more points and make smaller and smaller line segments, you get a total
			distance that grows and
			converges on the real value: &theta;<sub>radians</sub> * r.
		</p>

		<p class="question">Knowing this, what would be the arc length of a circle over 138 degrees if that circle had a
			radius 3.5 times the radius of a unit circle?
		</p>

		<p>
			Congratulations! You've just stumbled upon the origin of Euler's Method (pronounced oiler), and one of the
			basic principles of calculus!
		</p>

		<p>
			Still not convinced? Lets think about the circumference of a circle, which is &pi;d or 2&pi;r. If you have a
			90<sup>&deg;</sup> angle, that's 1/4 of the circumference and our arc length equation says we should get
			1/2&pi;r.
			So if we start with c=2/1*&pi;r=4/2*&pi;r, and you divide both sides by 4, you get 1/4*c=1/2&pi;r, which
			definitely
			matches!

		<h3><a id="Vectors">Vectors</a></h3>

		<p>
			A vector is an organized set of values. Each position represents a specific dimension, or aspect of the data.
			For instance, when calculating the slope of a line on a graph, you may take the rise and divide it by the
			run.
			This is calculated from y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>-x<sub>1</sub>, right? This also just
			so
			happens to describe a vector, seen here <math display="inline">
				<mfenced open="{" close="}" separators=",">
					<mi>&Delta;x</mi>
					<mi>&Delta;y</mi>
				</mfenced>
			</math>.
		</p>


		<p>
			This extends into as many dimensions as you like. Including by 1 dimensional vectors (also called scalars),
			3 and 4 element vectors like what are used in robotics and video games, or even 300 element vectors like
			in machine learning. All of the techniques we will talk about work across any sized vector. A vector is just
			an organized set of multiple numbers, that's it!
		</p>

		<p>
			What's also nifty is that, while people typically use the x - y - z pattern, any order is valid so long as
			it's consistent. For the sake of this library, we will stick with the x - y - z pattern.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<strong>Vector Addition</strong>

		<p>
			So we can describe a vector, so what? A lot, actually. Vectors are fundamental to a wide range of domains,
			and the most fundamental of all is vector addition. This is frequently called "tip to tail" as memorable
			visualization of the steps. You see when you place vectors tip to tail, and add the &Delta;x components
			together and then the &Delta;y components together, you get a new vector of x and y values. Take this image
			as an example.
		</p>

		<p align="center">
			<img src="vectors.png" alt="Vectors Image Not Found." title="Take a ruler out and see for yourself!" />
		</p>

		<p>
			This is an example of what happens when you add two velocity vectors together: <i>aim+moving=actual</i>.
			If you were to slide the <i>moving</i> vector to the right, so that the tail of it touched the tip of the
			<i>aim</i> vector, you would see the tip of <i>moving</i> touch the tip of <i>actual</i>. So lets look at
			the
			numbers then: <i>aim</i> is {2, 0}, <i>moving</i> is {-1, -1}, <i>actual</i> is {1, -1}.
		</p>

		<p class="question">
			What is the structure of the equations to produce the correct result? ( Give both numerical
			vector form,
			and individual equations for each element )
		</p>

		<hr />

		<strong>Unit Vector</strong>

		<p>
			There's a specialized type of vector called a unit vector, it's any vector with a magnitude/length of 1.
			There's a <i>big</i> reason it's called a unit vector, and it <i>definitely</i> ties back to the unit circle
			from before!
		</p>

		<p>
			For a moment, take another glance at both the <i>moving</i> and <i>actual</i> vectors above. They have different x
			values, but still have the same length: &radic;(2). This is because vectors of any number of dimensions
			all obey pythagoras theorem: a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>, or <i>hypotenuse</i> =
			&radic;(a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>). For vectors of 1 dimension, the magnitude is itself. For vectors
			of 3 dimensions, the magnitude is &radic;(a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>), and so on.
		</p>

		<p>Any vector can be <i>normalized</i> to a unit vector by dividing it by its length, and the results are
			incredibly useful as you can see in other articles within the library. The terms become trigonometric
			values, and can be applied in a wide range of scenarios as a set of scalars, or in element wise operations.
